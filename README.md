## Description

Design and implement a distributed temperature data-processing system evaluating a median temperature value for each device for a given time window. Temperature values are read from an MQTT message broker and submitted to a second MQTT broker (see protocol described below). MQTT brokers are out of the scope of this task, external services (considered reliable), credentials and URLs are given via config file mounted to the application docker container.
​
Sensor list is a diverse set of devices with integer IDs (up to 100 million instances).

Each device submits temperature values (in Celsius) with a variable random rate (1-10 times per sec) via MQTT protocol (qos = 1).

If there is no value submitted during 1 second from a single sensor system should delete last retained median temperature value from MQTT broker for a given device. Immediately after receiving the first value from a new device it should create a corresponding retained MQTT median value for a given device.

A median value time window is submitted to the system via a text-based configuration file (see file below).

The system should tolerate at least a single node failure (recover if a single instance becomes unavailable) and minimize rebalancing in case of changes of a number of nodes in the system (a kubernetes 'node').
​

### Nonfunctional requirements

- java-based solution;

- lean: minimise use of external libraries, keep only the necessary minimal set of tools;

- system should run on the top of a configured kubernetes cluster (k8s version: 1.11.2) running at least 3 nodes (on start).

### MQTT protocol

| Option name  | Inbound               | Outbound                     |
|-------------:|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|
| **topic**    | t/`<sensor_id>`       | median-t/`<sensor_id>`       |
| **message**  | `<temperature value>` | `<median temperature value>` |
| **qos**      | 1                     | 1                            |
| **retained** | flase                 | true                         |

### Configuration file

```yaml
temperatureTimeWindowInSec: <period_length_in_seconds> # up to 1000 seconds

# MQTT inbound client's settings
inbound:
 url: <url>
 user: <user>
 pass: <password>

# MQTT outbound client's settings
outbound:
 url: <url>
 user: <user>
 pass: <password>
```

## Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For building the project you need only a [Java compiler](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

> **IMPORTANT:** `median-meter` was tested and running with Java **11**, but also should work with **8** version.

And, of course, you need to clone `median-meter` from GitHub:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/xxlabaza/median-meter
$> cd median-meter
```

### Building

For building routine automation, I am using [maven](https://maven.apache.org).

To build the `median-meter` project, do the following:

```bash
$> ./mvnw package
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  8.906 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2019-01-15T10:21:22+03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Verify and run

To verify (execute **test**, **integration test** and [PMD](.codestyle/pmd.xml)/[checkstyle](.codestyle/checkstyle.xml)/[spotbugs](.codestyle/findbugs.xml)) and run the project, do the following:

```bash
$> ./mvnw package verify; && java -jar target/median-meter-1.0.0.jar
...
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]  T E S T S
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  14.588 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2019-01-14T17:07:57+03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello world
```

Also, if you do `package` or `install` goals, the tests launch automatically.

### Build docker image

```bash
$> ./mvnw package docker:build
...

## Kubernetes support

> **IMPORTANT:** `median-meter` has a prebuild [image](https://cloud.docker.com/u/xxlabaza/repository/docker/xxlabaza/median-meter) on `Docker Hub`, so you don't need to build it before using `Kubernetes`.

First of all, we need to provide a configuration file for median-meter service. I use a `ConfigMap` for that purpose and create it from already prepared `configuration.yml` file:

```bash
$> kubectl create configmap median-meter-configmap \
     --from-file=./src/main/kubernetes/configuration.yml

configmap "median-meter-configmap" created
```

Then, we could create our deployment, which persists previously created `ConfigMap` as file in container's file system:

```bash
$> kubectl create \
     -f ./src/main/kubernetes/deployment.yml

deployment.apps "median-meter" created
```

To see, deployments and existing pods - enter the commands below:

```bash
$> kubectl get deployments
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
median-meter   3         3         3            3           20s

$> kubectl get pods
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
median-meter-6d78dbccf4-64l9p   1/1       Running   0          21s
median-meter-6d78dbccf4-q9crj   1/1       Running   0          21s
median-meter-6d78dbccf4-xq5st   1/1       Running   0          21s
```

You also are able to see `pod`'s logs, like this:

```bash
$> kubectl logs median-meter-6d78dbccf4-64l9p
...

```

To remove `pod`s and `ConfigMap` entity, just type the following commands:

```bash
$> kubectl delete \
      daemonsets,replicasets,services,deployments,pods,rc,configmap \
      --all

replicaset.extensions "median-meter-749674d764" deleted
service "kubernetes" deleted
deployment.extensions "median-meter" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-6mv59" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-6st6k" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-8hjdg" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-9grzw" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-fs9f4" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-l5jth" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-nwkft" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-qjt9c" deleted
pod "median-meter-749674d764-w8wmc" deleted
configmap "median-meter-configmap" deleted
```

All previous commands together:

```bash
> kubectl delete \
      daemonsets,replicasets,services,deployments,pods,rc,configmap \
      --all \
    && \
  kubectl create configmap median-meter-configmap \
      --from-file=./src/main/kubernetes/configuration.yml \
    && \
  kubectl create \
      -f ./src/main/kubernetes/deployment.yml \
    && \
  sleep 20 \
    && \
  kubectl get deployments \
    && \
  kubectl get pods
```
